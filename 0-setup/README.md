# HuggingFace model access

Later in the tutorial you will run the `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct` model.

This model is "gated", which means it requires creating a HuggingFace account and requesting access.

Go to `https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct` and request the access *now* before proceeding with the next parts.

The requests are processed quickly so you should be granted access before you reach the relevant part of the tutorial.

If you are in a live tutorial and don't have access in time, ask a presenter for assistance downloading weights.
